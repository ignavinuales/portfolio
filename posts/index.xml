      <description>Brief Description This dataset reflects real predictive maintenance encountered in the industry with measurements from real equipment. The features description is taken directly from the dataset source.
Objectives:
Finding insights by doing an Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA). Developing two ML models. One for binary classification to predict Failure or No Failure. One for multiclass classification to predict Type of Failure. Exploring some insights from the results of the models. Challenges:</description>

Objectives:
Perform an Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA). Create a machine learning model to predict the diamond prices. Regression models used: Linear, Polynomial, Ridge, Lasso, and CatBoost.
The ten features and target are:
Weight: weight of the diamond. Length (x): length of the diamond. Width (y): width of the diamond Depth (z): depth of the diamond.</description>

      <title>Project 3: Battery RUL Prediction</title>

      <description>This project was developed as part of my masters degree. Battery Remaining Useful Lifetime (RUL) is an active field of research as batteries have become more important in recent years. The RUL of a battery can be usually estimated by its capacity (mAH). However, what if the capacity cannot be measured and the battery does not deliver real-time information about its current health state? The motivation behind the project is to determine the battery&amp;rsquo;s remaining cycles while it is charged and discharged using only voltage and current.</description>
