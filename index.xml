      <description>This project aimed at developing an API and Web App that are able to detect hate speech from text. Refer to the GitHub repo for a detailed explanation of the project and code:
You can also try out the app and give me feedback on the machine learning model performance:
I made the API publicly available ðŸ˜„ You may also want to make an HTTP request at this endpoint:
144.22.214.61:8000/detect Or even easier, check the FastAPI Swagger UI:</description>

      <description>This project aimed to create an app to detect people wearing face masks and if they are, whether they are worn correctly or not. The app is deployed on streamlint and you can use and test it by accessing the following link:
Objectives Automaticately detect people wearing face masks, not wearing masks, and wearing them incorrectly. Methodology First, some of the data were collected from open data sources. Then, I collected some other data by gathering personal photos from 2020 to 2022.</description>

      <title>3. Diamond Price Recommendation (Regression)</title>

      <description>This project aimed to create an app that gives price recommendations for diamonds. You can use and test the app by accessing the following link:
Furthermore, a Jupyter notebook is available on my Kaggle profile to see a step-by-step, detailed data analysis and check how the ML models were built and compared to each other:
Objectives Get insights from the data by an explanatory data analysis (EDA). Build a machine learning model capable of recommending diamond prices.</description>

      <title>4. Predictive Maintenance (Classification)</title>
      <link>https://ignavinuales.github.io/portfolio/posts/4_maintenance/</link>

      <guid>https://ignavinuales.github.io/portfolio/posts/4_maintenance/</guid>
      <description>The aim of this project was to train and test models that predict machinery failure. Due to the nature of the application, the biggest challenge was dealing with highly imbalanced data. Different techniques for under and over-sampling were used, as well as machine learning balanced models such as balanced random forest and balance bagging.
Two models were selected, one for binary classification (detects failures and not failure) and the other for multivariate classification, which detects types of failure.</description>

      <title>5. Credit Card Customer Segmentation (Clustering)</title>
      <link>https://ignavinuales.github.io/portfolio/posts/5_custumers/</link>

      <guid>https://ignavinuales.github.io/portfolio/posts/5_custumers/</guid>
      <description>Market segmentation is the process of breaking a large consumer or company market into smaller consumer groups based on similar characteristics.
This project aims at segmenting some active credit card holders to help the marketing department to build different strategies for each customer segment. Furthermore, after performing clustering, it is important to identify the customer profile of each cluster. Then,
Objectives: perform customer segmentation and identify customer profiles.
Methodology:
Explore and understand the data.</description>

      <description>I have always been passionate about data. However, my data science and machine learning journey truly started during my masterâ€™s degree at Fachhochschule Sudwestalen in Germany, where I became aware of the vast potential of ML and AI. Although I was learning a lot, it felt like the master was insufficient. So I started taking courses and doing certifications to strengthen my knowledge in the field.
As a part of my motivation to break into the field of ML on a professional level, it seemed like a good idea to share some of my work.</description>
