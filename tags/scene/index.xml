Objectives:
Perform an Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA). Create a machine learning model to predict the diamond prices. Regression models used: Linear, Polynomial, Ridge, Lasso, and CatBoost.
The ten features and target are:
Weight: weight of the diamond. Length (x): length of the diamond. Width (y): width of the diamond Depth (z): depth of the diamond.</description>

      <title>Project 3: Battery RUL Prediction</title>

      <description>This project was developed as part of my masters degree. Battery Remaining Useful Lifetime (RUL) is an active field of research as batteries have become more important in recent years. The RUL of a battery can be usually estimated by its capacity (mAH). However, what if the capacity cannot be measured and the battery does not deliver real-time information about its current health state? The motivation behind the project is to determine the battery&amp;rsquo;s remaining cycles while it is charged and discharged using only voltage and current.</description>
